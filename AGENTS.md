# AI Agent Guidelines

## Project Overview

This is a Go project. All source code is in Go. The project uses Go modules
for dependency management.

## Build & Test Commands

```bash
go build ./...          # Build
go test ./... -cover    # Run tests with coverage
go test ./... -race     # Run tests with race detector
golangci-lint run       # Run linter (uses .golangci.yml)
```

## Code Style

- Go source files should be small, cohesive, and responsibility-focused
- Target: ≤ 400 LOC for >80% of files
- More than 600 LOC is a strong indicator for splitting
- Keep functions focused and under 60 lines where practical.
- Follow standard Go conventions (`gofmt`, `go vet`).
- Use `golangci-lint` with the project's `.golangci.yml` configuration.
- Prefer returning errors over panicking.
- Use Go's standard error wrapping: `fmt.Errorf("context: %w", err)`.
- Do not use `panic()` in library code.

### Function and Method Documentation

Every exported function and method must have a godoc comment. Write it
like a good JavaDoc entry but with more emphasis on **context and usage
guidance** than a pure specification:

1. **First sentence**: A concise summary of what the function does,
   starting with the function name (Go convention).
2. **Parameters**: Document each parameter — its type, valid ranges,
   and what it controls.
3. **Return values**: What is returned on success and on error.
4. **Usage context**: When and why a caller would use this function.
   Mention typical call sites, related functions, or common patterns.
5. **Example** (optional but encouraged): A short inline example or
   reference to a testable example (`Example*` function).

Example:

```go
// DistanceForStrings computes the Levenshtein edit distance between
// source and target.
//
// Both source and target must be provided as []rune slices to ensure
// correct handling of multi-byte Unicode characters. Use []rune(s) to
// convert a plain string.
//
// The op parameter controls insertion, deletion, and substitution costs
// as well as an optional custom match function. Use DefaultOptions for
// standard unit costs or DefaultOptionsWithSub for unit-cost
// substitutions.
//
// Returns the minimum number of edit operations needed to transform
// source into target under the given cost model.
//
// Typical usage is fuzzy string matching, typo detection, or computing
// similarity scores (see also RatioForStrings for a normalized 0–1
// score). For a full edit script, use EditScriptForStrings instead.
func DistanceForStrings(source, target []rune, op Options) int { ... }
```

Unexported helpers do not require full documentation, but a one-line
comment explaining *why* the helper exists is expected.

## Testing Requirements

- All new functionality must include tests.
- Use table-driven tests where appropriate.
- Maintain at least 80% test coverage for every package.
- Run `go test ./... -race` before submitting changes.
- Fuzz tests are welcome for functions that parse external input.

### Test Documentation

Every test function must have a doc comment that reads **outside-in**.
Structure the comment in this order:

1. **User perspective**: What does the tested code achieve for the end user,
   described in the user's own terminology? Avoid implementation jargon.
2. **Context**: Which module, package, or feature area does the tested code
   belong to? How does it fit into the larger system?
3. **Concrete expectation**: What specific behavior is this test verifying?

Example:

```go
// TestPruneKeepsLatestHourly verifies that the backup pruning logic
// retains exactly one backup per hour for the most recent 24 hours,
// ensuring users never lose their latest hourly snapshot.
//
// This test covers the core retention algorithm in the pruning package.
//
// It sets up a directory with multiple backups within the same hour and
// asserts that only the chronologically latest entry survives while the
// others are moved to the "to_delete" directory.
func TestPruneKeepsLatestHourly(t *testing.T) { ... }
```

For table-driven tests, document the overall test function with the
outside-in structure and give each sub-test case a descriptive name
that reads as an assertion (e.g. `"returns error for empty input"`).

## Commit Messages

- Use imperative mood ("Add feature", not "Added feature").
- Start with a verb.
- Limit subject line to 72 characters.
- Prefix dependency updates with `deps-upd:`.
- Separate subject from body with a blank line.

## Dependencies

- Minimize external dependencies.
- Only add dependencies to well-maintained sources.
- All dependencies are managed via Renovate (see `renovate.json`).
- Run `go mod tidy` after adding or removing dependencies.
- Do not add dependencies with known vulnerabilities.

## Security

- Never commit secrets, credentials, or API keys.
- The `gosec` linter is enabled — do not disable it.
- Validate all external input at system boundaries.

## CI/CD

- Always run linters at the end of each task.

## File Organization

- Keep the top-level package clean; use subdirectories for internal packages.
- Test files live next to the code they test (`foo_test.go` next to `foo.go`).
- Generated code goes in clearly marked directories excluded from linting.
